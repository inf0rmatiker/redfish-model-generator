// Chassis - A Chassis represents the physical components for any system.  This resource represents the sheet-metal confined spaces and logical zones like racks, enclosures, chassis and all other containers. Subsystems (like sensors), which operate outside of a system's data plane (meaning the resources are not accessible to software running on the system) are linked either directly or indirectly through this resource.
